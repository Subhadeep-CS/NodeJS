In node.js every file consider as a module.

Suppose I have two file one file is first.js and another file is add.js.So I have two module inside node.js and Now in add.js module I have a add function, now I want to use that add function inside my first.js module.How we can to that.

To do this we have a specific function in node.js that's require function.

The behaviour of require() function:-

require function takes a parameter that's a module and execute that module in line by line. As we know javascript is a single threaded programming language,So each line execute
